- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email on: erencan.pelin@gmail.com
- Check out my YouTube channel where I teach game development & C# : https://www.youtube.com/ErenCant

I'm an experienced game, app & software developer!
I know c#, visual basic, java, javascript, python, as well as HTML & CSS! While I'm mostly self taught in programming, I'm currently studying a Bachelor of science in IT and
a Bachelor of Creative Intelligence & Innovation!

I started programming through game development and while that's where I currently specialise, I'm working on branching onto other areas of software development by learning 
different APIs and IDEs.

I've developed many games, apps and software in the last few years, some of these are featured on my YouTube channel, as I constantly like to channel myself and my ability.
I've learnt how to create AI simulated flocking algorithms (BOIDS), 3D procedurally generated models, and much more!
